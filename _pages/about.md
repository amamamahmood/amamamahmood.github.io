I am [Malone Postdoc Fellow](https://malonecenter.jhu.edu/postdoctoral-researchers/) in [Malone Center for Engineering  in Healthcare](https://malonecenter.jhu.edu/) & [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/) at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/). I am co-advised by [Dr. Chien-Ming Huang](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~cmhuang/), [Dr. Ziang Xiao](https://www.ziangxiao.com/), and [Dr. Paul Yi, MD](https://www.stjude.org/people/y/paul-yi.html).

My research, situated at the intersection of HCI and Health, focuses on enhancing human-machine interactions to support health and well-being. Specifically, I develop AI assistants-powered by LLMs-that enable seamless, adaptive interactions by understanding user behaviors in various real-world contexts. I design, develop and evaluate AI assistants that support personal health and well-being through continuous, personalized assistance and augment clinical practices effectively and seamlessly. With a focus on empowering special populations such as older adults in managing their health to facilitate aging in place, my work emphasizes situated, long-term, sustainable, "in the wild" human-machine interactions.
