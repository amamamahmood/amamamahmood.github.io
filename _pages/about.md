I am fifth year Ph.D. candidate at Department of Computer Science, Johns Hopkins University. I am a member of [Intuitive Computing Lab](https://intuitivecomputing.github.io/), which is affiliated with the [Malone Center for Engineering  in Healthcare](https://malonecenter.jhu.edu/) and [Laboratory for Computational Sensing and Robotics](https://lcsr.jhu.edu/). I am advised by [Dr. Chien-Ming Huang](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~cmhuang/)

My research, situated at the intersection of HCI, AI and Robotics, focuses on enhancing human-machine interactions to support health and well-being. Specifically, I develop conversational agents-powered by LLMs-that enable seamless, adaptive interactions by understanding user behaviors in various real-world contexts. With a focus on empowering older adults in managing their health to facilitate aging in place, my work emphasizes situated, long-term, "in the wild" human-machine interactions.

My CV may be viewed [here](https://amamamahmood.github.io/assets/pdf/CV-Amama-Mahmood.pdf).

I am on the job market for tenure track faculty positions.
